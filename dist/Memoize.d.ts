* Memoize builds a wrapper function that caches results of previous executions.

*
* NOTE: As of now, there are no cache eviction mechanisms.
*   You should try to use Memoized functions in a 'disposable' way as a result
*
* NOTE: Memoize is not 'thread-safe' currently.  If two calls are made for the same object currently,
*   two calls to the wrapped function will be made
*
* NOTE: Memoize will cache errors as well as results.
*
* @param {AsyncTask} task - the task function to memoize.
* @param {function=} keyFunction - a function that synchronously generates a key for a request.
* @returns {AsyncTask}
