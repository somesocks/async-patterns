* Memoize builds a wrapper function that caches results of previous executions.
* As a result, repeated calls to Memoize may be much faster, if the request hits the cache.
*
* NOTE: As of now, there are no cache eviction mechanisms.
*   You should try to use Memoized functions in a 'disposable' way as a result
*
* NOTE: Memoize is not 'thread-safe' currently.  If two calls are made for the same object currently,
*   two calls to the wrapped function will be made
*
* NOTE: Memoize will cache errors as well as results.

* @param {function=} keyFunction - a function that synchronously generates a key for a request.
